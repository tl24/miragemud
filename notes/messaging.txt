Messaging
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having consistent and discoverable message ID's is important for AI (mob 
programs).  Mob AI will work primarily off of messages sent for different 
events, just like a player would react to.

Types of Messages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Self-only Response: This is a response to a command that only affects the 
player and does not send any message to any other player.  Examples include 
score, look, equipment and other informational or administrative commands.

Prompt: This usually prompts the player for information or just the standard 
prompt.  Examples include login, character creation, confirmation and the 
standard prompt.

Multi response: This is a response to a command by a user or mob that not only
affects them but others as well.  Examples include directional commands, combat,
chat, etc.


Message Naming:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Messages should generally share the namespace of the command they are triggered 
by with the exception of certain common error messages or other shared messages.

Response to the initiating player (for self-only and multi-targeting commands)
For Success:
	<namespace>.<command>.<self>[.<substatus>] substatus can be present if there
		multiple results
For Failure (including validation failure)
	<namespace>.<command>.<self>.failed[.<substatus>]
	
Response to non-initiating players:
	<namespace>.<command>[.<substatus>]
	Failures broadcast to others aren't as common, but are similar to the response to the player
	<namespace>.<command>.failed[.<substatus>]

Prompts:
	<namespace>.prompt.<name>

Any common or shared messages should begin with common in the namespace and possibly
other elements if there is a need to subdivide further.
