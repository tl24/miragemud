Sensory Events
=========================
Hierarchy of events, with the possibility of some events overriding others.
For example arrival, might have sight sense, auditory sense, and potentially smell.

sight => Foo has arrived.
  auditory => You hear footsteps.
  smell => You smell rotted meat.
  
If you can see, probably don't care about auditory, but if you're blind you definitely want the auditory.
Maybe there is a scale or something so if one sense event is weak compare to another you don't get them all.  Possibly combine all that apply.

Examples:
Foo has arrived, smelling like rotted meat.
You hear footsteps and smell rotted meat.

var evt = new SensoryEvent("char.arrival");
evt.Add(new VisualEvent("${target} has arrived.", actor, EventStrength.Primary));
evt.Add(new AudibleEvent("footsteps", EventStrength.Compute(actor.Weight, 10)));

Room.Send(evt);

actor.Send(Confirmation.Get("east", "You leave east"));
